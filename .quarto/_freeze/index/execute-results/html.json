Numerous scenes from the movie remain iconic and are still frequently discussed today. However, we cannot deny that it also portrays one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, which claimed the lives of thousands and caused many families to lose their beloved members.\n\nThe raw dataset was obtained from Kaggle, an open-source data platform. Upon reviewing the dataset, data quality issues were identified in the Cabin, Age, SibSp, and Parch columns. I believe these issues are significant enough to potentially distort the accuracy of the analysis, based on several rounds of testing. As a result, this analysis will focus solely on **understanding the passenger structure** using the more reliable aspects of the data—specifically, **survival status, ticket class, embarkation point, and gender distribution.**\n\nThe analysis will be carried out base on following methods:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Name           |link

This may reflect the societal structure during the Edwardian era, where women had limited access to employment opportunities and, consequently, lower purchasing power to afford a ticket on the Titanic.\n\nBased on embarkation data, it appears that residents from Southampton were relatively wealthier compared to those from Cherbourg and Queenstown, as the number of passengers from Southampton was nearly double the combined total from the other two locations.\n\nAdditionally, the distribution of ticket classes reveals an interesting pattern: third-class tickets had the highest concentration, followed by first class, and then second class. This may suggest that the middle class was not a dominant segment in the society at the time.\n\nLastly, the survivability rate presents a stark contrast between genders—100% of male passengers perished, while 100% of female passengers survived. This suggests that the survival pattern may have been influenced by deliberate planning, where men possibly sacrificed their lives to protect their family members.\n",
